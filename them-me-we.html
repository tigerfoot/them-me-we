Bruno is born when computers were still weighed in tons, and punch cards the favorite media. 
He fell in love with computers in 1991, experimenting first with DOS, Netware, OS/2 & Windows. 
He started his consultancy career in 1996, and since 1998 is established in Switzerland (Jura) where he co-founded Ioda-Net Sarl with Françoise Wybrecht.
He has always had a strong interest in free software and the open source movement, and finally escaped from using proprietary systems himself in 2001.
Since then, Bruno is using and contributing to various open projects like KDE, Bacula, Bareos, Mapserver, postgis, openSUSE.

His biggest conviction is if there's a future, it can only be Free.

Member of different French associations, he is also KDE supporter and FSFE fellowship.
Actually Bruno is Board Member at openSUSE.	

When computers leave him some spare time, he's dreaming to be part of the Aéropostal challenges, 
or how to make the world a more collaborative & free place.

Welcome, fasten your seat belt! 
<br />
First, thanks for your presence and thanks to all openSUSE mini-summit organizers.
<br />
I love the optimistic way of life. Perhaps a bit too much, to be able to resume in 20 minutes, 20 years of life with computers. :-)
<br />
So I will focus on certain key points. 
<br />
I deeply hope they will help you to jump into the free world if you're not in yet.

        <aside class="notes">
In 1998, after being certified Microsoft Engineer since 4 years, and doing consulting in computer's services as freelancer. 
<br />
We (mean Françoise and Myself) decided that the time to create a common consulting enterprise had come.
<br />
We founded Ioda-Net Sàrl at that time, located in Switzerland, not that far from Basel.

        <aside class="notes">
At that time we needed a bunch of software for our servers.
<br />
Be it script languages, databases engine, network management and so on.
<br />
I met then those groups of people who were proposing free and open source software.

If you run an enterprise, you have to respect the law. There's no alternative.
<br />
As a small start-up, we didn't have a big budget to spent on licenses or fees.
<br />
Using free software in our case help us to build the business.

        <aside class="notes">
My most important need was covered.
<br />
Me become a free software user.
<br />
And it didn't took that much time before I became an advocate.

In a sense this was the first form of giving back to the community.

    <aside class="notes">
You certainly have a special interest on a particular domain. Be it related to your job, or as a hobby.
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if some other share the same in the free world. Try to find them, and start to learn how
to contribute and interact with.
<br />
At the beginning, try as much as you can to concentrate your effort on only one subject. 
<br />
The world is so big, you could loose yourself and your motivation if you act like a bee.

    <aside class="notes">
From my point of view, the first step is to find a kind of home sweet home.

it is a basic and essential need of the ME.

Choices will happen, influenced by people you will meet.

Around 2005, with a Debian distribution, absolute reference for servers at that time, I encountered my first clash.
<br />
Inside the delivered pure-ftpd package there was a missing compilation flag. (--enable large-file)
<br />
I opened a bug, and this one got a WONTFIX answer :
<br />Quote: there's no reason to have support for file over 4GB. End Quote
<br />
I had seen one, delivering the first DVD iso to end users :-)

But Debian's rules were clear, maintainer is god.

Okay, I'm already hearing you shouting: it's free software after all, you can pick the source, adapt, and recompile as you like!
<br />
Of course, yes we can. 
<br />
But honestly there's a time when, if you have to recompile more than half of what you need. 
<br />
You start to dream of greener grass fields.

Moving, Jumping....
<br />
This reaction is quite typical of new comers inside the free and open source world.
<br />
They will jump from one project or distribution to another one every time they will find an "unsolvable" bug.
<br />And we certainly done it like this, and do it again any time we discover a new project.
<br />But honestly nothing is giving better results than fixing things by ourselves.

I deeply believe, that what makes the success of my first contributions what the fact to recognize

    <aside class="notes">
During the 2004 2009 period, I made numerous bugs reports against openSUSE distribution.
<br />
In 2006 the project openSUSE was born, with the idea to share and add openess, with the objective to be finally driven by the community.
<br />
By slow steps at the beginning, opening one box at a time.
<br />In 2009 it became more evident. Almost everything was opened to contribution.
<br />
February 2009, was also my first Fosdem. We will talk about Fosdem a bit later. 
<br />
At openSUSE Booth, my eyes can't stop rolling.

Are bug reports also counting? Yes

Me win its t-shit I'll contribute...

I pass the details about the euphoric effect. I will involve myself more and more. 
<br />October the first community conference is organized at Nuremberg. I'm there :-) 
<br />And my presence increase on mailing list, irc channels

<br />Stop whining, if there's a bug, do your best to reproduce it, get a back-trace, and communicate with all parties involved like

    Cédric drill down the QT code to explain how to do "string escaping" in sql statement, the way it should.
